I'm a software engineer passionate about designing effective architecture, improving processes, and scaling teams.

I lead of team of Software Engineers and Data Analytics Engineers at AMP Robotics. We're collecting the data and providing the insights to enable a world without waste.

For fun, I am tinkering with embedded programming (with Rust), riding mountain bikes, and perfecting my homemade Carne Adovada.
