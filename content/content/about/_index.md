Hi, I’m Connor Denman, a seasoned software engineer and leader passionate about building transformative solutions at mission-driven startups. From coding iOS apps in middle school to growing teams at seed-stage and post-Series C companies, I’ve spent over a decade solving complex challenges in Biotech, Robotics, AI, Healthcare, Aviation, Ecommerce, and Fintech.

Specializing in infrastructure, data engineering, AI ops, and backend systems, I architect scalable platforms and transform engineering cultures to deliver high-quality software, faster.

I thrive on tackling tough problems with impact and pragmatism. Let’s create something extraordinary together!
