Hi, I’m Connor Denman, a seasoned software engineer and leader with a passion for building scalable, impactful solutions at mission-driven startups. From my early days coding iOS apps and games in middle school to leading platform engineering at high-growth companies, I’ve spent over a decade tackling complex challenges in infrastructure, data engineering, AI ops, and backend development.

I thrive at the intersection of technology and strategy, transforming engineering cultures and architecting systems that empower teams to deliver high-quality software faster. Currently, I spearhead platform engineering initiatives, designing robust infrastructure and streamlining DevOps processes to drive business growth and innovation. My work has powered 4x dataset growth, slashed cloud costs by 50%, and reduced deployment failures from 40% to under 10%—all while fostering collaboration and pragmatism.

Whether leading teams, architecting multi-cloud solutions, or diving into code, I’m driven by a relentless focus on impact and a knack for solving the tough problems others shy away from. Let’s build something extraordinary together.
