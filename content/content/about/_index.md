Hi, I’m Connor Denman, a seasoned software engineer and leader passionate about building transformative solutions at mission-driven startups. From coding iOS apps and games in middle school to leading platform engineering at seed-stage and post-Series C companies, I’ve spent over a decade solving complex challenges in Biotech, Robotics, AI, Healthcare, Ecommerce, and Fintech.

Specializing in infrastructure, data engineering, AI ops, and backend systems, I architect scalable platforms and transform engineering cultures to deliver high-quality software, faster. Currently, I’m spearheading platform engineering at a Series A startup, having previously scaled a cloud engineering team from inception to support a 200+ employee Series C company.

Whether leading teams or coding multi-cloud solutions, I thrive on tackling tough problems with impact and pragmatism. Let’s create something extraordinary together.
